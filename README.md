# scylla-cli

Python script for managing and repairing (in a smart way) Scylla Cluster.
It repairs the primary range of a Scylla node in discrete steps using 
[advanced repair techniques](https://www.datastax.com/dev/blog/advanced-repair-techniques).

## Prerequisites

* Python >=3.5
* SSH connection or direct access to every Scylla host in the cluster should be possible
* Scylla REST API listens on every Scylla host on `<localhost|IP>:10000`

Following env variables could be set to make your life easier:
```
export SCYLLA_HOST='10.210.92.46' # initial endpoint for obtaining cluster topology
export SCYLLA_USERNAME='root' # ssh user on Scylla host
export SCYLLA_PKEY='/home/USER/.ssh/id_rsa' # Defaults to ~/.ssh/id_rsa
export SCYLLA_CONNECTION_METHOD='ssh' # or 'direct'
```

## Installation

```
pip3 install scylla-cli
```

## Developing
```
virtualenv -p python3 scylla-cli
pip3 install --editable .
```

## Checking cluster status
```
scli status
```

## Repairing Scylla Cluster
```
# connect to the cluster via 10.210.92.46 with root credentials and repair
# sync keyspace on every endpoint in local DC only
$ scli -u root -p repair sync --local

# connect to the cluster via 10.210.92.46 with root credentials and repair
# sync keyspace on 10.210.92.46 only
$ scli -u root -p repair sync --local --hosts 10.210.92.46

# connect to the cluster via 10.210.92.46 with root credentials and repair
# sync keyspace on every host except 10.210.92.46
$ scli -u root -p repair sync --local --exclude 10.210.92.46
```
